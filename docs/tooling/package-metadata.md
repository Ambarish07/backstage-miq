description: An inventory of well known package metadata fields in the Backstage ecosystem.
---

The `package.json` file is a JSON file that contains metadata about a JavaScript package, and in required for all package publish to NPM or a similar package registry. It is a [Node.js standard](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html) that is expanded upon in the [NPM ecosystem](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json).

## Known Metadata Fields

This section documents the known `package.json` metadata fields that play a significant role in the Backstage ecosystem.

All [fields defined by NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) are inherited by the Backstage ecosystem. The list below only includes those standard fields for which additional information is available.

### `name`

The name of the package, as defined by [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#name). In addition, the following naming scheme is strongly encouraged for packages published in the Backstage ecosystem:

First pick a package name prefix that is unique to your organization or collection of packages, but also places it within the Backstage ecosystem, for example: `@example/backstage`, `@example-backstage/`, or `example-backstage`. This prefix should be used by all packages that you publish, regardless of whether they're part of a plugin or not.

Any package that is not part of a plugin should use the prefix along with a descriptive name, for example: `@example/backstage-components` or `@example/backstage-foo-client`.

For plugin packages you should also pick a plugin ID and add `plugin-<pluginId>` to the prefix, along with a suffix based on the package role:

- `<prefix>-plugin-<pluginId>`: The main frontend code of the plugin.
- `<prefix>-plugin-<pluginId>-module-<name>`: Optional modules related to the frontend plugin package.
- `<prefix>-plugin-<pluginId>-backend`: The main backend code of the plugin.
- `<prefix>-plugin-<pluginId>-backend-module-<name>`: Optional modules related to the backend plugin package.
- `<prefix>-plugin-<pluginId>-react`: Shared widgets, hooks and similar that both the plugin itself and third-party frontend plugins or modules can depend on.
- `<prefix>-plugin-<pluginId>-node`: Utilities for backends that both the plugin backend itself and third-party backend plugins or modules can depend on.
- `<prefix>-plugin-<pluginId>-common`: An isomorphic package with platform agnostic models, clients, and utilities that all packages above or any third-party plugin or module can depend on.

For example, a frontend package for the `poetry` plugin might be called `@example/backstage-plugin-poetry`, and a backend package for the same plugin might be called `@example/backstage-plugin-poetry-backend`.

If you are creating a module for an existing package that is not part of your project, you should use the same prefix along with the plugin ID of the package that the module is for. For example, if you are creating a poetry provider module for `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend`, you might call it `@example/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-poetry-provider`.

### `repository`

This field can be generated by the `backstage-cli repo fix --publish` command. The only requirement is that the `package.json` in your workspace root has the `repository` field documented.

### `main`

The main entry point of the package, pointing to the source file for development. This field along with other entry point fields such as `module` and `types` are rewritten when packaging the package for distribution. You can read more about this process in the [publishing](./cli/02-build-system.md#publishing) section, and it is also used for [backend production builds](./cli/02-build-system.md#backend-production).

### `exports`

The exports of the package, as defined by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports). This field is used to define the entry points of the package. As with other entry point fields, the exports should point to source files for development. They will the be rewritten when packaging the package for distribution. You can read more about this in the [sub-path exports](./cli/02-build-system.md#subpath-exports) section.

### `typeVersions`

This field is used to specify the type entry points for the package, the TypeScript equivalent of the `exports` field. TypeScript also supports defining this in the `exports` field, but that requires that the `moduleResolution` option in `tsconfig.json` is set to `node16` or `bundler`, which we currently do not support.

This field can be generated by the `backstage-cli repo fix` command. First fill out the `exports` field to point to source fields, which will then be used to generate the `typeVersions`.

### `sideEffects`

This field declares whether it is safe to remove unused code when bundling this package into a frontend build, and is defined for example by [WebPack](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/8d5cdb5d536cc8eb444da4b57dca4e36716f4535/plugins/auth-backend-module-google-provider/config.d.ts#L22).

This field can be generated by the `backstage-cli repo fix` command. It will set to `false` by default for all frontend packages, since Backstage frontend packages should generally never have any side effects. If your package does have side effects, you can set explicitly set this field to `true`.

### `scripts`

The package scripts as defined by [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#scripts). The Backstage CLI provides a set of standard scripts, which you can read more about in the [build system](./cli/02-build-system.md) section. The full list of scripts is as follows:

```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "backstage-cli package start",
  "build": "backstage-cli package build",
  "lint": "backstage-cli package lint",
  "test": "backstage-cli package test",
  "clean": "backstage-cli package clean",
  "prepack": "backstage-cli package prepack",
  "postpack": "backstage-cli package postpack"
}
```
